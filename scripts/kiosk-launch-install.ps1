# Kiosk Launch Install Script
# Install command for the "SmartSenior Kiosk Launch" Win32 app: sets up the
# NFC/QR reader daemon and registers the Edge kiosk auto-launch task. This
# script is identical across every tenant device — it reads the tenant's home
# URL from C:\ProgramData\SmartSenior\config.json rather than hardcoding it,
# so only that small per-tenant config script needs to differ per site.
#
# Autologin signs in the shared kiosk account (kiosk@smartsenior.onmicrosoft.com)
# automatically on every boot. The password is stored via the LSA secret store
# (see lib-lsa-secret.ps1) rather than the plaintext Winlogon registry value.
#
# DESIGN NOTE — why nothing here is allowed to throw:
# This runs under Intune's SYSTEM account. If any step throws (a missing driver
# file, a vendor installer that hangs in session 0, an LSA hiccup) the whole
# script would die before writing the detection marker in the finally block, and
# Intune reports "not detected" (0x87D1041C) even though the important work ran.
# So every step is best-effort: it logs a WARNING and continues instead of
# aborting. The detection marker is written in a finally block so it is reached
# no matter what happens above. Individual failures are recoverable — the reader
# daemon re-runs from its own scheduled task, and drivers can be reinstalled.
